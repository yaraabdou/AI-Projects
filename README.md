# AI-Projects
This repository serves as a portfolio of my work in deep learning and AI, primarily originating from coursework and personal exploration. It demonstrates my hands-on experience with various AI concepts and techniques, which I believe are crucial for effective AI Product Management. My goal is to continually expand this repository with more diverse and challenging projects.

This project explores the application of Vision Transformers (ViTs) for automated skin lesion classification. Early detection of skin cancer is crucial for successful treatment, and deep learning models like ViTs offer promising solutions for improving diagnostic accuracy.

**Key Features:**

* **Dataset:** Utilizes the HAM10000 dataset, a publicly available collection of dermoscopic images of skin lesions with corresponding diagnoses.
* **Model:** Implements a ViT-based classification model, leveraging transfer learning from a pre-trained ViT model.
* **Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using accuracy metrics and visualizes results with a confusion matrix.
* **Fine-tuning:** Explores techniques to fine-tune the pre-trained ViT model for improved performance.
* **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Employs Keras Tuner to search for optimal hyperparameter values.
* **Live Demo:** Provides an interactive demo for users to upload images and receive predictions.

**How it Works:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The HAM10000 dataset is organized and preprocessed for training.
2. **Model Development:** A ViT-based model is implemented and trained using transfer learning.
3. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics and visualizations.
4. **Fine-tuning and Optimization:** The model is fine-tuned and hyperparameters are optimized.
5. **Live Demo:** An interactive demo allows users to classify new images.
